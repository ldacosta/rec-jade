\opening{Dear Sir/Madam,}

It is my pleasure to recommend Jade Guisiano for a post-graduate position. I am a research professional working at the \href{http://crim.ca}{CRIM} (Computer Research Intitute of Montreal); I came to work with Jade when she was doing her internship as part of her Master's degree (May~to September~2018). The internship involved studying the way how deep learning could be applied to problems involving elements represented as graphs. Jade distinguished herself by replicating results of state-of-the-art papers and communicated their results in concise, clear ways. The result of her work is reflected in her Master's memoir, but is also summarized on a Medium post that can be found \href{https://medium.com/@jade.guisiano}{here}.


Jade has good communication skills; her written work is clear, concise and interesting. Even though she was undertaking an internship in a domain she had limited exposure to, she applied herself properly and was able to demostrate her advances in our bi-weekly team meetings at the CRIM. Jade was highly proficient in applying the material she found on her explorations in analyzing the problem
situations. She made the conscious effort to explain her views concisely and gave supporting arguments that were both
clear and persuasive. 


At a personal level, Jade is a well disciplined, interested student with a pleasant personality. Throughout her time at the CRIM, Jade demonstrated great
perseverance and initiative. Not only was she interested in and motivated to learn the material, but she also
put great work into assimilating it to her own experience and developing her own ideas about her future work and studies.

Jade would greatly benefit from the opportunities for intellectual development provided by
a sustained period of graduate study. She has proven herself to have the perseverance, initiative, and drive to succed in such a demanding path.


\closing{Sincerely,}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
